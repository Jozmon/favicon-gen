# Favicon Gen
Simple script to generate favicons in different resolutions and their necessary HTML tags for a website

## Requirements

Inkscape installed on the system and the source image for the favicons in SVG format.

## Usage
Make sure to have the script in the same folder as the source image. This image must be named "favicon.svg" and have a 1:1 ratio.

After running the script, it will ask for a name and a route. The name is only for creating the destination folder and it could be anything valid as a folder name. And the route is the one to use as the href attribute for the favicons (something like "/img/").

I'm just starting to learn about coding. I made this extremely simple script just to save some time while I'm practicing creating different websites.
